## About Me

I am currently pursuing my PhD at the [IMAPP institute at Radboud University, Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/imapp/), where I am supervised by [Badri Krishnan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iN7wHH4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Erik Schnetter](https://perimeterinstitute.ca/people/erik-schnetter). My research focuses on numerical relativity and gravitational self force. As a side project I am developing higher order accurate Summation by Parts Operators  for spherical symmetry. As part of my academic journey, I have transitioned to working with [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and this decision has been incredibly rewardingâ€”I have fully embraced it and never looked back.

## Research Interest

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam finibus ipsum
ac erat aliquam dapibus. Vestibulum vehicula placerat ex, a consectetur odio
pharetra quis[^1]. Mauris id urna ante.

Fusce pharetra diam ac nisi aliquet, velegestas ex iaculis. Pellentesque
laoreet cursus tellus sed pellentesque. Praesent a rhoncus elit[^2]. Nunc
